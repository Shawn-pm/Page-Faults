# Page-Faults
### Operating System/Assignment-3: Created by [Dr. Trevor Bakker](https://github.com/trevorbakker-uta)

## Descirption
Program that implements the FIFO, Optimal, MFU, and LRU page-replacement algorthims. 

## Funtionality
* With a given page-reference string, the code outpurs the number of page faults incurred by each algorithm.
* Condition - page number ranges from 0 to 9.

## Things I learned
* How to calculate page-replacement algorithms.

## Compilation Instructions
The application is built in an omega server at UTA.
In terminal:
```
gcc pf.c -o pf 
pf datafile.txt
```
